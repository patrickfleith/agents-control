# agents-control

**Keep control of your coding agents and your codebase.**

Carry your goals, decisions and next steps into the next coding session.
Pick up where you left off, give different agents the same project context,
and keep your personal working notes out of the team's Git history.

A lightweight framework for managing your coding agents' project context.

## Make each session build on the last

- **Spend less time explaining the project.** Give your agent saved requirements,
  technology choices and decisions to read before it starts work.
- **Keep work moving across sessions.** Record open questions and concrete next
  steps so you can return to a feature with a clear starting point.
- **Keep your workflow personal.** Plan work in any Git checkout with local notes
  and personal skills that preserve the repository's shared setup.
- **Choose what your agents remember.** Read and edit their project context
  yourself. Keep useful decisions and discard notes that no longer help.

## Quickstart

Requires macOS or Linux, Git, curl, and a coding agent that can read local files.

### 1. Install once

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickfleith/agents-control/main/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add the PATH setting to your shell configuration for future terminals.
For Cursor, see [agent setup](#agent-setup).

### 2. Set up a project

Inside your project's Git checkout:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
agents-control init
```

This creates your Git-excluded `docs-agents-private/` folder and starter documents.

### 3. Fill your project context

Ask your agent:

> Use ac-init to fill my private project context from the codebase. Ask me about
> goals or requirements you cannot establish.

### 4. Use the workflows

Name a workflow in your request:

| Skill | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| `ac-init` | Set up and fill private project context |
| `ac-log` | Capture a task, idea, technology choice, concern or question |
| `ac-decide` | Record, revise or revoke a decision with its rationale |
| `ac-glossary` | Define project terms and resolve conflicting meanings |
| `ac-write-manual` | Write or update a private user manual from the codebase |
| `ac-commit` | Organize code changes into atomic conventional commits |
| `ac-unslop` | Keep writing clear and concise |

Try these requests:

> Use ac-log to add a task: test retry behavior when the service is unavailable.

> Use ac-decide to record that we chose SQLite for the local cache because we
> need persistence without running a separate database service.

> Use ac-log to capture a concern: retrying a payment request could create a
> duplicate charge.

> Use ac-commit to organize these changes into commits.

## Details

### How it works

agents-control stores ordinary Markdown in `docs-agents-private/`, beside your
code. A small CLI handles setup and document paths. Personal `ac-` skills help
your agent keep the notes useful as you work. A skill is a reusable set of
instructions for a specific task.

Setup adds the folder to `.git/info/exclude`, the local Git exclusion file,
and preserves existing project files. Skills live in your user skill folders.
The writing workflows resolve private document paths before editing. `ac-commit`
checks the Git index for private files before each commit.

### Agent setup

For Codex and Claude Code, the installer adds personal skills and instructions
that ask the agent to load your project context. For Cursor, paste
`~/.agents-control/cursor-user-rule.md` into User Rules.

If your agent does not load the context automatically, ask:

> Run agents-control context and read the private documents relevant to this task.

Check your setup with:

```sh
agents-control doctor
```

For a local checkout of agents-control, see the
[local installation instructions](docs/usage.md#installation-and-discovery).

### What lives in the private folder?

```text
your-project/
  docs-agents-private/
    AGENTS.md       Personal instructions and document guide
    PRD.md          Project goals, requirements and users
    STACK.md        Technology choices
    ROADMAP.md      Upcoming work
    DECISIONS.md    Decisions and their reasons
    TASKS.md        Personal tasks
    CHANGELOG.md    Changes worth remembering
```

`init` creates the structure. You and your agent supply the project knowledge.
Rerunning setup preserves your existing notes. Each checkout, including linked
worktrees, has its own private folder.

Optional documents cover ideas, concerns, questions, terminology, a user manual,
tests, evaluations, interface guidelines and deployment. Larger features can have
their own requirements and implementation plan. Create these only when needed;
the [document guide](docs/usage.md#optional-documents) lists the available types.

### How context carries forward

At the start of a session, `agents-control context` returns personal instructions
and the private folder's location. Your agent reads the documents relevant to its
task. As you work, use the skills to capture decisions, questions and follow-up
work. The next session can pick up those files.

Keep notes current and focused. A short explanation of a decision or a concrete
next step is usually more useful than a transcript of the conversation.

### Updates and further reading

Rerun the installer to update. Your private notes stay in each checkout. Locally
edited skills or conflicting files stop the update so you can review them.

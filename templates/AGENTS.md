# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this repo. Codex and Cursor read
this file directly, Codex cloud tasks included. Claude Code reads it through the
one-line `CLAUDE.md` adapter (`@AGENTS.md`). Keep it compact and current.

## How to work here

- **What this is:** <one line: what this project is and who it's for>.
- Before acting, consult the relevant project doc below.
- Keep changes minimal and in the style of the surrounding code.

## Writing rules

Everything you write follows `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md`: answers in chat,
docs, commit messages, PR text. Read it before you write.

## Project docs

Project docs live in `docs-agents/`. Consult the relevant one before acting. If a
doc does not exist yet, do not fabricate one. Create it with the skill noted below.

| Doc          | Path                     | What it captures                        | Skill          |
|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Manual (SUM) | docs-agents/SUM.md       | Install + usage guide for end users.    | `write-manual` |
| Decisions    | docs-agents/DECISIONS.md | Pending (TBD) and settled decisions.    | `decide`       |
| Glossary     | docs-agents/GLOSSARY.md  | Agreed term definitions.                | `glossary`     |
| Stack        | docs-agents/STACK.md     | Frameworks, libraries, tools.           | `log`          |
| Tasks        | docs-agents/TASKS.md     | Repo-level todo dump.                   | `log`          |
| Ideas        | docs-agents/IDEAS.md     | Captured ideas / possibilities.         | `log`          |
| Concerns     | docs-agents/CONCERNS.md  | Risks and concerns to investigate.      | `log`          |
| Questions    | docs-agents/QUESTIONS.md | Open questions + answers once resolved. | `log`          |

## Capabilities

Skills live in `.agents/skills/`, committed with the repository so local and
cloud sessions use the same workflows. Codex and Cursor discover that directory
natively; `.claude/skills/` is a **generated** adapter for Claude Code, which
reads only its own path.

Never edit `.claude/skills/` by hand. Write the skill in `.agents/skills/` and
run `agents-control adapters`. Invoke a skill as `/name` in Claude Code, `$name`
in Codex, or by asking for it in Cursor. Currently available:

- `commit`: turn uncommitted work into atomic conventional commits.
- `log`: append an entry to STACK, TASKS, IDEAS, CONCERNS, or QUESTIONS.
- `decide`: record and manage decisions in DECISIONS.
- `glossary`: add and refine agreed terms in GLOSSARY.
- `write-manual`: write or update the SUM from the codebase.
- `unslop`: writing rules for anything an agent writes. Always applies.
